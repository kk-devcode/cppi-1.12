.SH NAME
cppi \- indent the C preprocessor directives in FILE to reflect their nesting
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fI-c \fR[\fIOPTION\fR] [\fIFILE\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Indent the C preprocessor directives in FILE to reflect their nesting
and ensure that there is exactly one space character between each #if,
#elif, #define directive and the following token, and write the result
to standard output.  The number of spaces between the `#' and the following
directive must correspond to the level of nesting of that directive.
With no FILE, or when FILE is \-, read standard input.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-ansi\fR
when checking, fail if text follows #else or #endif
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-check\fR
set exit code, but don't produce any output
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\-files\-only\fR
don't generate diagnostics about indentation;
print to stdout only the names of files that
are not properly indented
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-max\-string\-length\fR=\fILENGTH\fR
fail if there is a double\-quoted string longer
.TP
than LENGTH;
if LENGTH is 0 (the default),
.IP
then there is no limit
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
print this help, then exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
print version information, then exit
.PP
With the \fB\-c\fR option, don't write to stdout.  Instead, check the
indentation of the specified files giving diagnostics for preprocessor
lines that aren't properly indented or are otherwise invalid.
.PP
Note that \fB\-\-ansi\fR without \fB\-\-check\fR does not correct the problem of
non\-ANSI text following #else and #endif directives.
.SS "The exit code will be one of these:"
.IP
0 all directives properly indented
1 some cpp directive(s) improperly indented
1 if text follows #else/#endif (enabled with \fB\-\-check\fR \fB\-\-ansi\fR)
2 #if/#endif mismatch
3 file (e.g. read/write) error
4 found a double\-quoted string longer than the specified maximum
.PP
A pragma directive may have its `#' indented.
